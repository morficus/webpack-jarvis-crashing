# webpack-jarvis-crashing
A basic project to demonstrate an issue with Webpack-Jarvis v0.3.0 crashing

## Instalation

* run `npm install`

and your done ^_^

## Replicating issue

(take a look at the vide webpack-jarvis-crashing.mov)

* Start the application by running `npm run dev`
* Notice in the console output that Jarvis starts as normal
* Once the webpack is done building and the application is running... point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and confirm that the application is running.
* Now go to the Jarvis console by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:1337`...
* Take a look at the CLI.... Jarvis (and the application) should have now crashed
